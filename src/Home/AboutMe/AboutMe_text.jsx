    Hello, Zuzana here! I&apos;m a former food technologist with a master&apos;s degree
    from UCT Prague. Recently, I shifted away from a food industry to pursue a more
    creatively fulfilling path. I taught myself front-end web development, where I can
    blend scientific approach with digital creativity.
